# Disciple Tools
A disciple relationship management system for discipleship making movements.

## Description
Disciple Tools is a disciple relationship management system especially designed to support outreach projects using digital marketing to accelerate disciple making movements (DMM).

## Purpose
There needs to exist a simple, low-cost, highly distributable DRM that is tailored to the process of using digital marketing to accelerate disciple making movements. Most DRM solutions are too expensive to be used by small volunteer teams, and they often require significant configuration and development to implement. This project is attempting to make a rapid launch, low cost system that is tailored for movements.

## Platform
We are building on the Wordpress platform because of its open-source availability, simplicity of installation, numerous low cost hosting options, multi-lingual support, substantial configurability and customization, giant development community and resources, native REST API, mobile readiness, and healthy market place for distributing themes and plugins.

## Wiki

Don't forget, we have a [wiki for Disciple Tools](https://github.com/DiscipleTools/disciple-tools-theme/wiki).

## Theme

This repository contains only the WordPress theme. There are a growing number of plugin extensions to the theme, but the core of the Disciple Tools system is this theme.

## How to Install
The goal of the project is to create a disciple-making DRM that is incredibly simple, cheap, and fast to launch. Below are the simple steps to do that.

**Note: You must have php 7 or above. php 5.6 will not work.**

### Step 1

- Login to your Admin Dashboard. `http://{your website}/wp-admin/` 

> Note: You have to be an administrator with the permissions to install plugins.

### Step 3
- In the Admin area, go to `Appearance > Themes` in the left navigation. This is where themes are installed.
- Select the `Add New` button at the top of the screen.
- Then select the `"Upload Theme` button at the top of the screen.
- Use the `choose file` button to find the disciple-tools-theme.zip file you saved in step 1, and upload that file and wait for Wordpress to install it.

### Step 4
- Once uploaded, you will see the new Disciple Tools Theme installed with other themes. Next `Activate` the theme.

Done! You now have a complete coalition management system for your movement.
